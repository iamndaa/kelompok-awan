<p>The next video about Databases is from my other course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/?referralCode=FFF295AECF3594CE440E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery</strong></a>. I have included it as an optional video in here to give you a better idea of how databases work. In the next video you can assume that you could write a server in Python (instead of the Node.js + Express.js that I mention in the video --this is JavaScript based). Enjoy it!</p>
